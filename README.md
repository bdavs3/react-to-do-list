# react-to-do-list

### Description

A basic [React](http://reactjs.org) web-app built for learning purposes. Inspired by a similar exercise found in Microsoft's [frontend bootcamp](https://github.com/microsoft/frontend-bootcamp).

### Functions

- Add items to the to-do list by typing in a text field and clicking a button or pressing 'enter'
- Check mark the items when they are finished
- Remove items that are finished by pressing a 'clear completed items' button
- Switch between three views: 'all', 'to-do', and 'completed'

### Road-blocks

This is where I'll keep track of significant struggles I have in the process of coding this.
